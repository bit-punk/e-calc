# ECalc

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.5.

It provides a simple form for calculating the electric-power consumption of devices in standby-mode:
* Ability to calculate power consumption of devices in standby-mode
* Calculates the yearly costs of electric power consumption of devices in standby
* Uses internationalization (i18n) for improving user interaction
* GitHub Actions are incorporated for build-automation
